        My Name is Rob Houck I currently reside in Cleveland, OH and am looking
        to make a career change. For the last twelve years I have found myself
        exploring the Cleveland culinary scene. After many great years I decided
        I needed a change. In October of 2019 I decided to take a leap of faith
        and enrolled in the Lambda School Full Stack Web Development program.
